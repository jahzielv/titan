# Titan
A simple Gemini server. Configurable via TOML or Rust, depending on your tastes and time restraints. Very much under construction.

## Aims
- A command line plug-n-play server that can be configured via a Titan.toml file, which will specify the routes;
- A Gemini server framework, which can be used to create custom Gemini servers with more functionality than the plug-n-play server;
- Maybe some other stuff like a Markdown -> text/gemini compiler?
